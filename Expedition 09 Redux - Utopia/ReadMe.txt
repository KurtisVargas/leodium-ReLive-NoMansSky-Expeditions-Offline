Lore
-----
Utopia introduces the Utopia Foundation and challenges players to work together and rebuild a solar system.

Changes to the SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json file
------
- EndTimeUTC value --> 2893423600
- All the steps involved in online base validation have been set to AutoValidation ... but beware: you'll still need to build the base to be able to move forward ... In order, you'll need: the base computer, 4 wooden floors, 7 large wooden walls and 4 pieces of wooden roof. See the attached image for an idea of the model.
- An incorrect mission statement. I can't find the right value to put back, but you can read the details in the mission log.

Bug ?
---
None recorded to date. Let me know if you have one :p

How do you do it?
------------------
Simply copy/paste a file into a directory ... No modification/influence on saves !!! No intervention on game files ...

a) First of all, set your game software to "Offline".

b) Then, download the file "SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json" from the cache directory of the expedition you wish to redo.

c) Replace the file in your [cache] directory with the one you've just downloaded
-> Steam PC : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache
-> Steam Mac : ~/Library/Application Support/HelloGames/NMS/cache
-> MS Store/GOG : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache

d) Restart "No Man's Sky" in offline mode and start a new game "Expedition".
