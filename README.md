You are now in a directory of [SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json] files, allowing you to relive past No Man's Sky Expeditions as they were when they were released. Introduced with the Expeditions update, this mode features a series of time-limited events that begin at a fixed point in the universe. This allows the community to "embark on a shared journey". Each expedition is built around a series of milestones. These objectives can be achieved in any order, allowing players to obtain specific rewards, meet other players and experiment with different ways of playing.

Here is the directory of the **REDUX versions of Expeditions**, the latest stable versions offered by HelloGames.
Although the first versions are stored in the [PastVersionExp 01-08 NoRedux] directory.

**It is preferable to load the Redux versions. The content is almost identical and the rewards are strictly the same.**

<b>Progression through the stages preserved so that rewards can only be obtained when the objectives have been reached in order to earn them ... After all, we're hero explorers! </b>
<i>We are Brave and Fearless Hero Travellers ... No need for CheatMode</i>

# How do you do this?
<i>Just copy/paste a file into a directory ... No modification/influence on saves !!! No intervention on game files ...</i>
- First, set your game software to "Offline".
- Then download the "SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json" file from the cache directory of the Expedition you want to redo.
- Replace the file in your [cache] directory with the one you've just uploaded

  <i>-> Steam PC : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\st_{steamId64}\cache

  -> Steam Mac : ~/Library/Application Support/HelloGames/NMS/st_{64BitSteamID}/cache

  -> MS Store/GOG : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\NDefaultUser\cache</i>

- Restart "No Man's Sky" in offline mode

<b>Details</b>
- Modification of the access period so that you can access it whenever you want, with no time limit.
- <b>Progression through the stages preserved so that rewards can only be obtained when the objectives have been reached in order to earn them ...</b>
- Changed the number of Tech slots in the exosuit to correct the fact that, at the start, the technologies were in the normal inventory (so remember to move/replace them at the start of the Expedition if necessary).
