/!\ This is a test file /!\

Why > 
The Exp10 Phase05 Milestone03 "Sentience Echo" cannot be validated as we are "offline".  With this json file, the milestone should activate itself.

How >
The procedure is to play/explore for a few minutes while an automatic backup is made. When it's done, exit the game and reload it. The milestone should be auto-validated ...

After>
Let me know if it works! (^^)
