ReLive-NoMansSky-Expeditions-Offline

You are now in a directory of SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json files, allowing you to relive past No Man's Sky Expeditions as they were when they were released

- Modification of the access period
- Progression through the stages preserved so that rewards can only be obtained when the objectives have been reached in order to earn them ... 
- Changed the number of Tech slots in the exosuit to correct the fact that, at the start, the technologies were in the normal inventory (so remember to move/replace them at the start of the Expedition if necessary).
