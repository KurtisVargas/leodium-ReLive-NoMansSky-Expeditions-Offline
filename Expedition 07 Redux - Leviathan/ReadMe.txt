Expedition 07 Redux - Leviathan
===============================

This file is >> AlsoInProgress << and supervised by Polo & Nada.
It is playable for the most part but perhaps not yet 100% functional.
However, a majority of the rewards will be accessible from your other saves.

We're working on it.

Lore
-----
Leviathan traps Travellers inside a time loop, and offers a taste of roguelike gameplay. Difficulty is tuned to survival mode settings, and every death means a reset of the loop.

Changes to the SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json file
------
EndTimeUTC value --> 2893423600 (so that it can still be done today)
Added the ability to activate expedition via the Nexus desktop


Bug ?
---
None recorded to date. Let me know if you have one :p

How do you do it?
------------------
Simply copy/paste a file into a directory ... No modification/influence on saves !!! No intervention on game files ...

a) First of all, set your game software to "Offline".

b) Then, download the file "SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json" from the cache directory of the expedition you wish to redo.

c) Replace the file in your [cache] directory with the one you've just downloaded
-> Steam PC : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache
-> Steam Mac : ~/Library/Application Support/HelloGames/NMS/cache
-> MS Store/GOG : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache

d) Restart "No Man's Sky" in offline mode and start a new game "Expedition".
