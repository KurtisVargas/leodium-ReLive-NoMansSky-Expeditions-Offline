# ReLive-NoMansSky-Expeditions-Offline

>Replay ALL No Man's Sky Expeditions

You are now in a directory of SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json files, allowing you to relive past No Man's Sky Expeditions as they were when they were released

Introduced with the Expeditions update, this mode features a series of time-limited events that begin at a fixed point in the universe. This allows the community to "embark on a shared journey".

Each expedition is built around a series of milestones. These objectives can be achieved in any order, allowing players to obtain specific rewards, meet other players and experiment with different ways of playing.

<b>How do you do this?</b>
- First, set your game software to "Offline".
- Then download the "SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json" file from the cache directory of the Expedition you want to redo.
- Replace the file in your [cache] directory with the one you've just uploaded

    -*Steam : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\st_{steamId64}\cache*

    -*MS Store/GOG : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\NDefaultUser\cache*

- Restart "No Man's Sky" in offline mode

<b>Details</b>
- Modification of the access period
- Progression through the stages preserved so that rewards can only be obtained when the objectives have been reached in order to earn them ...
- Changed the number of Tech slots in the exosuit to correct the fact that, at the start, the technologies were in the normal inventory (so remember to move/replace them at the start of the Expedition if necessary).
