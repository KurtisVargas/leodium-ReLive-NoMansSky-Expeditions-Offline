Lore
-----
Crossover event with Mass Effect, awarding the SSV Normandy SR1

Changes to the SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json file
------
EndTimeUTC value --> 2893423600 (so that it can still be done today)
StartingSuitTechSlots value --> 8 (to have Tech slots available since they were mixed up with the inventory at the time)

Bug ?
---
- The Myth Beacon was already in the inventory at the start because it came from stage 3 of phase 5, which was to be carried out "in a community of Travellers".
- No other bugs have been reported to date. Let me know if you have one :pm

How do you do it?
------------------
Simply copy/paste a file into a directory ... No modification/influence on saves !!! No intervention on game files ...

a) First of all, set your game software to "Offline".

b) Then, download the file "SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json" from the cache directory of the expedition you wish to redo.

c) Replace the file in your [cache] directory with the one you've just downloaded
-> Steam PC : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache
-> Steam Mac : ~/Library/Application Support/HelloGames/NMS/cache
-> MS Store/GOG : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache

d) Restart "No Man's Sky" in offline mode and start a new game "Expedition".
