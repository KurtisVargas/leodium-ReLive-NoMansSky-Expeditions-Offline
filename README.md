> [!NOTE]
>You are now in a directory of [SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json] files, allowing you to relive past No Man's Sky Expeditions as they were when they were released. Introduced with the Expeditions update, this mode features a series of time-limited events that begin at a fixed point in the universe. This allows the community to "embark on a shared journey". Each expedition is built around a series of milestones. These objectives can be achieved in any order, allowing players to obtain specific rewards, meet other players and experiment with different ways of playing.


- <i>Here is the directory of the **REDUX versions of Expeditions**. I've opted for the Redux versions because they're more recent and less likely to have bugs as a result of updates made by HelloGames since their release. 
- Although the first versions are stored in the [PastVersionExp 01-08 NoRedux] directory but - they are only partially kept up to date -.
- The directory [SeasonDataCacheAllOriginalFiles] contains the original HelloGames json files without any intervention on my part.</i>

 
# 📓 How do you do this?
- First, set your game software to "Offline". 
<sup>(Steam and GoG have an Offline mode) (worst case scenario: cut the wifi or network)</sup>
- Then download the "SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json" file from the cache directory of the Expedition you want to redo.
- Replace the file in your [cache] directory with the one you've just uploaded

  <i>-> Steam PC : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\st_{steamId64}\cache

  -> Steam Mac : ~/Library/Application Support/HelloGames/NMS/st_{64BitSteamID}/cache

  -> MS Store/GOG : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\NDefaultUser\cache</i>

- Restart "No Man's Sky" in offline mode 
<sup>(You can play in online mode, but if HelloGames launches a new expedition, you risk losing the progress of the expedition you are currently redoing. That's the only risk involved.)</sup>

📎 <b>Details</b>
- Modification of the access period so that you can access it whenever you want, with no time limit.
- <b>Progression through the stages preserved so that rewards can only be obtained when the objectives have been reached in order to earn them ...</b>
- Changed the number of Tech slots in the exosuit to correct the fact that, at the start, the technologies were in the normal inventory (so remember to move/replace them at the start of the Expedition if necessary).
