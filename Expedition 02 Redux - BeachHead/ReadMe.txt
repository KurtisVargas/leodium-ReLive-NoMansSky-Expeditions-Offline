Tip
-----
Phase 03 Stage 02 "The Murkey Veil"
The stage is to "visit" a swampy planet and it seems that the game only considers the stage to be validated when the "swampy planet" marker is "discovered for the 1st time when you land". 
If it's been scanned with your freighter's scan, it's considered as just "re-visited" and not as "discovered for the 1st time when you land".
I don't think I could do anything about that ... So you have to be careful ...

Changes to the SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json file
------
EndTimeUTC value --> 2893423600 (so that it can still be done today)

Bug ?

- No other bugs have been reported to date. Let me know if you have one :pm

How do you do it?
------------------
Simply copy/paste a file into a directory ... No modification/influence on saves !!! No intervention on game files ...

a) First of all, set your game software to "Offline".

b) Then, download the file "SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json" from the cache directory of the expedition you wish to redo.

c) Replace the file in your [cache] directory with the one you've just downloaded
-> Steam PC : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache
-> Steam Mac : ~/Library/Application Support/HelloGames/NMS/cache
-> MS Store/GOG : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache

d) Restart "No Man's Sky" in offline mode and start a new game "Expedition".
